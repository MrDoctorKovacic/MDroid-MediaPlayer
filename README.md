# MDroid-Media
A very simple Bluetooth media controller for my car. It's my first React Native app adapted from my earlier [Web Media Control](https://github.com/MrDoctorKovacic/web-media-control/blob/master/index.php), which was attempting to mimic Apple CarPlay. This has been updated to no longer rely on a PHP interface for the DBus, and has been completely integrated into my MDroid project. 

Only tested on Android, iOS likely won't build.

`npm install && react-native run-android`
